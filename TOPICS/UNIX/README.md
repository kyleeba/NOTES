# Unix Notes

- If we want to copy a directory from somewhere to our current working
  directory, the command is as follows:
  ```
  cp -r [source path] [target path]
  ```
  If we want to copy a folder named 'sumAll' into our current working
  directory, with the same title, we would do as follows:
  ```
  cp -r /Users/kyleeagron/Desktop/ODIN/LOOPS/javascript-exercises/sumAll .
  ```
    - The [.] command in the second argument copies it to the current working
      directory
    - The first argument is the location of our source directory
    - The '-r' flag instructs the computer to recursively copy the contents of
      the directory we are trying to copy from.

- To reach your parent directory you can:
  ```
  cd ..
  ```
