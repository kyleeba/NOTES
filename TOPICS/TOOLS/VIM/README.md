### Vim notes
- The command for saving is as follows:
  ```
  >> press escape to enter normal mode
  :w
  ```
- The command for quitting is as follows:
  ```
  >> press escape to enter normal mode
  :q
  ```
- We can combine commands as follows:
  ```
  >> press escape to enter normal mode
  :wq
  ```
  This will save and quit in the same command
